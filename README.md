# Shell-operator

Shell-operator is a tool for running event-driven scripts in a Kubernetes cluster.

* Simple configuration
* A fixed script execution order
* Run scripts on startup, on schedule or on Kubernetes events.

This operator is not an operator for a particular software as prometheus-operator. Shell-operator provides an integration layer between Kubernetes cluster events and shell scripts by treating scripts as hooks for events. Think of it as a Kubernetes operator framework for scripts.

Shell-operator provides:
- Ease the management of a Kubernetes cluster by using the tools that Ops are familiar with: you can use bash, python, ruby, kubectl, etc.
- Kubernetes object events: hook can be triggered by add, update or delete events.
- Object selector and properties filter: Shell-operator can monitor only particular objects and detect changes in their properties.
- Simple configuration: hook binding definition is a JSON structure on stdout.

## Quickstart

> You need to have a Kubernetes cluster, and the kubectl must be configured to communicate with your cluster.

To use Shell-operator you need to:
- build an image with your hooks (scripts)
- (optional) setup RBAC
- run Deployment with a built image.

### Build an image with your hooks

A hook is a script with the added events configuration code. Learn [more](HOOKS.md) about hooks.

Create project directory with the following Dockerfile, which use the [shell-operator](https://hub.docker.com/r/flant/shell-operator) image as FROM:
```
FROM flant/shell-operator:latest
ADD hooks /hooks
```

In the project directory create `hooks/002-hook-schedule-example` directory and the `hooks/002-hook-schedule-example/hook.sh` file with the following content:
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

if [[ $1 == "--config" ]] ; then
  echo '{"onStartup": 10, "schedule":[{"name":"every 10sec", "crontab":"*/10 * * * * *"}]}'
  exit 0
fi

echo "002-hook-schedule-example onStartup run"
echo "Binding context:"
cat "${BINDING_CONTEXT_PATH}"
echo
echo "002-hook-schedule-example Stop"
```

Build image and push it to the Docker registry.

### Use image in your cluster

To use the built image in your Kubernetes cluster you need to create a Deployment.
Create a `shell-operator.yml` file describing deployment with the following content:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: shell-operator
spec:
  containers:
  - name: shell-operator
    image: registry.mycompany.com/shell-operator:monitor-namespaces
```
Replace `image` with your registry and add credential if necessary.

Start shell-operator by applying `shell-operator.yml`:
```
kubectl apply -f shell-operator.yml
```

Analyze Shell-operator logs with `kubectl get logs POD_NAME` (where POD_NAME is a name of a Shell-operator Pod). You should see logs like the following:
