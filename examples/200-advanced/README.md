## advanced example

Use Deployment to install shell-operator with several hooks.


### Run 

Build shell-operator image with custom scripts:

```
$ docker build -t "registry.mycompany.com/shell-operator:advanced" .
$ docker push registry.mycompany.com/shell-operator:advanced
```

Edit image in shell-operator-pod.yaml and apply manifests:

```
$ kubectl create ns example-advanced
$ kubectl -n example-advanced apply -f shell-operator-rbac.yaml  
$ kubectl -n example-advanced apply -f shell-operator-deploy.yaml
```

Create ns to trigger onKubernetesEvent:

```
$ kubectl create ns foobar
```

See in logs that startup hooks are run in order and all other hooks are triggered:

```
$ kubectl -n example-advanced logs deploy/shell-operator
...
INFO     : TASK_RUN HookRun@ON_STARTUP namespace-hook.sh
007-onstartup-2 hook is triggered
...
INFO     : TASK_RUN HookRun@ON_STARTUP namespace-hook.sh

$ docker rmi registry.mycompany.com/shell-operator:advanced
```
